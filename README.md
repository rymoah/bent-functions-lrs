GitHub repository for the experimental data of the paper:

M. Gadouleau, L. Mariot, S. Picek: Bent Functions in the Partial Spread Class Generated by Linear Recurring Sequences

Preprint available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08705

## Experimental Data

All functions investigated in the paper are reported inside the directory data/. The subdirectory n*/ indicates the number of variables of the Boolean functions, while all remaining relevant parameters are reported in the filenames, in particular:

- The type of bent functions considered (either PS- or PS+)
- The degree b of the feedback polynomials used for the construction (either 1 or 2, only in one case we have b=3 for n=6 variables)

So, for example, `n8/functions_n8_ps-_b2.txt` contains the data for all PS- bent functions of 8 variables constructed with polynomials of degree 2.

## File Structure

Each file has a header reporting the parameters used for the construction, namely:

- number of variables n
- exponent l of the finite field extension GF(2^l)
- degree of the polynomials b
- total number of polynomials available for the construction
- type of bent function (PS- or PS+)
- number of polynomials needed to construct a single function

Then, all subsequent rows report the relevant data for all bent functions generated by the LRS construction with the stated parameters. In particular, for each function we report:

- truth table in hexadecimal format
- nonlinearity value (just a double check, since these are bent functions the nonlinearity is always equal to 2^(n-1) - 2^(n/2-1))
- algebraic degree (from the experiments it turns out it is always the maximum possible, i.e. n/2)
- 2-rank of the adjacency matrix for the translate design (used in the paper for classification up to EA-equivalence)
- List of polynomials used to construct the function
